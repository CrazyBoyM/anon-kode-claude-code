Analyze the current codebase for optimization opportunities:

**Performance Analysis:**
- Identify performance bottlenecks in the code
- Memory usage patterns and potential leaks
- CPU-intensive operations that could be optimized
- Network requests that could be batched or cached
- Database queries that might be inefficient

**Code Quality Improvements:**
- Dead code elimination opportunities
- Redundant operations or calculations
- Inefficient algorithms or data structures
- Bundle size optimization for frontend code
- Dependency analysis and cleanup

**Architecture Recommendations:**
- Caching strategies (Redis, in-memory, CDN)
- Load balancing and scaling considerations
- Microservices vs monolith trade-offs
- Database indexing and query optimization
- API design and rate limiting

**Implementation Priority:**
- High-impact, low-effort optimizations first
- Performance monitoring and metrics setup
- A/B testing framework for optimization validation
- Automated performance regression detection

Please provide specific, actionable optimization recommendations with estimated impact and implementation complexity.
